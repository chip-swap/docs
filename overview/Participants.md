# Participants

The Chipswap ecosystem is primarily comprised of four types of users: fans, liquidity providers, traders, and developers. Fans trade tokens as part of their efforts to support influencers. Liquidity providers are incentivized to contribute BEP20 tokens to common liquidity pools. Traders can swap these tokens for one another for a fixed 0.30% fee (which goes to liquidity providers). Developers can integrate directly with Chipswap smart contracts to power new and exciting interactions with tokens, trading interfaces, retail experiences, and more.

In total, interactions between these classes create a positive feedback loop, fueling digital economies by defining a common language through which tokens can be pooled, traded and used.

## Fans

Fans trade tokens as part of their efforts to support influencers. Liquidity providers are incentivized to contribute BEP20 tokens to common liquidity pools. 

## Liquidity Providers

Liquidity providers, or LPs, are not a homogenous group:

Passive LPs are token holders who wish to passively invest their assets to accumulate trading fees.

Professional LPs are focused on market making as their primary strategy. They usually develop custom tools and ways of tracking their liquidity positions across different DeFi projects.

Token projects sometimes choose to become LPs to create a liquid marketplace for their token. This allows tokens to be bought and sold more easily.

## Traders

There are a several categories of traders in the protocol ecosystem:

 - Speculators use a variety of community built tools and products to swap tokens using liquidity pulled from the Chipswap protocol.
 - Smart contracts that execute trades on the protocol by implementing swap functionality.

In all cases, trades are subject to the same flat fee for trading on the protocol. Each is important for increasing the accuracy of prices and incentivizing liquidity.

## Team and Community

The Chipswap team along with the broader Chipswap community drives development of the protocol and ecosystem.
